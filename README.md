## Programming_for_Social_Science (GEOG5995 The University of Leeds)

This repository contains Python code for an artificial basic agent based model. By running the code an animation is produced which 
replicates the movement of sheeps (white dots) and wolves (black dots) and once the all the sheeps are eaten the animation stops. 
The stopping process is triggered by a condition where, if the wolves are at a certain give distance from the sheeps, they eat the sheeps. 

The main part of the code is based on the [GEOG5995 Programming for Social Scientists](http://www.geog.leeds.ac.uk/courses/computing/study/core-python-phd/)
module from The University of Leeds. Some extra parts were added such as:
* the part of the code which adds wolves
* an option to run the code from the command line by directly imputing argument values
* property to make the x and y variable private
